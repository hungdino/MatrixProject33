# MatrixProject33
OOP Homework #1
Introduction
In this homework, your goal is to implement a 3x3 matrix class that enables common matrix operators such as add, minus, multiply, divide, inverse, and determinant (all as you learned in linear algebra course). Since a 3x3 matrix is composed of three 3x1 vectors, we ask you to implement a 3x1 vector class first, and then utilize this class to implement the matrix class.
Requirement
1. Implement all constructors, operators and methods we declared in class vector3 and matrix33. See the attached code for a complete list of functions.
2. Implement them in vetor3.cpp, matrix33.h and matrix33.cpp, respectively.
3. Do NOT revise any member we declared including their parameters, return types, etc.
4. However, you can add some functions to help your implementation if necessary.
Grading
We will use a series of test data to judge if you had all functions work correctly. Your score will base on the number of test data your program can process. We have included some test data in the attached file for you to evaluate your program.
Submission
Please zip the following 4 files : vetor3.h, vetor3.cpp, matrix33.h, matrix33.cpp and upload StudentID.zip
